#NOTEs
#1. - surface produciton of iodine, HONO, or other species are controlled in - model_toolbox/diffusion_1d.m and model_toolbox/surface_source.m
#update this for your case!

#2. We recommend a grid betweeen about 10-20 meters that is log scale with decreasing box sizes clsoe to the ground, with the lowest model layer on the order of the millemeter scale, the scale appropriate for molecular diffusion.  Between your lowest available Kz and the ground, we recommend you inpterpolate such that tfor the lowest model level Kz = 0.  We calculate online the molecular diffusifity and use it to transport gases into the lowest model level
