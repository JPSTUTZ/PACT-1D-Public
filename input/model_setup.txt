#NOTEs
#1. - if you would like surface production of species at the ground this can be set in - model_toolbox/diffusion_1d.m and model_toolbox/surface_source.m
#update this for your case!

#2. We recommend a grid betweeen about 10-20 meters that is log scale with decreasing box sizes close to the ground, with the lowest model layer on the order of the millemeter scale, the scale appropriate for molecular diffusion.  Between your lowest available Kz and the ground.  We calculate online the molecular diffusifity and use it to transport gases and add it to Kz to treat vertical mixing.
